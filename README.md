# Bingo Slot Game

## Overview

Bingo Slot Game is a server-side application developed using Spring Boot. It manages a Bingo-based slot game, allowing users to place bets, track game progress, and maintain historical data using Redis and MySQL.

## Features

- Users can place bets on different rows and columns.
- The game processes user bets and determines winners.
- Game state management to control different phases (**NoGame, Bets Open, In-Game**).
- Tracks game statistics and bet frequency using Redis and MySQL.
- Stores game history for analysis.
- Randomized number selection each round.
- 3x3 slot-style gameplay mechanics.
- Line completion for winnings.
- Multiplier bonus for connected lines.
- Hint system to show possible winning numbers and their respective win amounts.
- Risk-reward system with strategic marking.

## Implementation Details

- The **main logic** of the game is implemented using **multithreading**, where **vertical and horizontal operations** are processed separately to ensure efficient execution.
- A **linked list** is used as the primary data structure, as it provides an optimal approach for managing and traversing game states.
- A **Scheduler Service** is used for managing time constraints, particularly for tracking the **bets open duration** and transitioning between game states.
- A **Configuration File** is included in `java/com.bingo.slotGame` to manage game settings and environment variables.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- The game is played on a **3x3 grid**:
  ```
  1   4   7  
  6   9   11  
  8   15  21  
  ```
- Each turn, a **random number** from the matrix is selected.
- If the number **is not marked**, it gets **marked**.
- The game continues until all numbers are marked.

## Winning Conditions

- Completing a **full row or column** grants **money equal to the last number** that completed it.
- If the new line **touches another previously completed line**, a **multiplier is applied**:

  **Win = (Number of connected lines) Ã— (Last number used to complete the line)**
- Multiple lines can be completed in a single turn, increasing the reward potential.

## Example Rounds

### Scenario 1: Simple Line Completion

1. **Spin: "4"** â†’ Marked âœ…  *(No win yet)*
2. **Spin: "7"** â†’ Marked âœ… *(Still no full row)*
3. **Spin: "1"** â†’ **Row completed!** â†’ **Win: 1** ðŸ’°

### Scenario 2: Multiplier Bonus

1. **Spin: "6"** â†’ Marked âœ… *(No win yet)*
2. **Spin: "9"** â†’ Marked âœ… *(Still no full row)*
3. **Spin: "11"** â†’ **Row completed!** â†’ **Win: 11** ðŸ’°
4. **Spin: "21"** â†’ **Row + Column completed!** â†’ **Multiplier applied!** â†’ **Win: 42** ðŸŽ‰

### Hint System

- After every round, the game will display **possible numbers that can complete a line** and their respective **win amounts**.
- Example:
  - If **4 and 7** are marked, the game will suggest **"Mark 1 to complete the row"** and display the **potential win amount (1)**.
  - If **6 and 9** are marked, the game will suggest **"Mark 11 to complete the row"** and display the **potential win amount (11)**.
  - If **15 and 21** are marked, the game will suggest **"Mark 8 to complete the row"** and display the **potential win amount (8)**.

## Technologies Used

- **Java & Spring Boot** - Backend development
